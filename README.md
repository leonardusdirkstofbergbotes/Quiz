# Quiz
My first quiz using PHP as the server side language


A simple quiz showcasing some of my php knowledge and thinking.  Also my first attempt in animations.  

I store all my questions in an associative array and include that file where needed

i use an if function to validate if the users input value mathes my desired answer.  if its true it incriments a varaible and at the end the vairable will be echod as your TOTAL CORRECT ANSWERS. 

I mainly used CSS to do animation and a little bit of jquery when css was not suffiecient enough. I did not want to overdo it with animation as this is a pretty basic and simple quiz page.
